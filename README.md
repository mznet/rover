# Getting Started
Rover is a Chrome extension that enables you to search your bookmarks exclusively with your keyboard, much like Spotlight. You can activate this extension using the Command + Shift + K combination and then effortlessly search for your bookmarks using keywords. Alternatively, you have the option to customize the shortcut on the Chrome extension shortcut page (chrome://extensions/shortcuts).

# Build
```
$ npm run build
```
